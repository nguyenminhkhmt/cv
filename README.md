"_Of course_," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is a **little moxie**!"

**_If you're thinking to yourself, This is unbelievable, you'd probably be right._**

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
> His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
> He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

* Azalea (_Ericaceae Rhododendron_)
* Chrysanthemum (_Anthemideae Chrysanthemum_)
* Dahlia (_Coreopsideae Dahlia_)

* Calculus
    * A professor
    * Has no hair
    * Often wears green
* Castafiore
    * An opera singer
    * Has white hair
    * Is possibly mentally unwell

1. Cut the cheese

    Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

    Be careful when holding the knife.

    For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.  

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

> **YAML** (/ˈjæməl/ and [YAH-ml][YAML 71]) (see [§ History and name][YAML link2]) is a [human-readable data-serialization language][YAML link3]. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as [Extensible Markup Language][YAML link4] (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from [SGML][YAML link5].<sup>[1][YAML link7]</sup> It uses both [Python][YAML link6]-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps<sup>[1][YAML link7]</sup> thus JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.<sup>[2][YAML link8]</sup>

> **Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is a [markup language][XML link1] and [file format][XML link2] for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. It defines a set of rules for encoding [documents][XML link3] in a format that is both [human-readable][XML link4] and [machine-readable][XML link5]. The [World Wide Web Consortium][XML link6]'s XML 1.0 Specification<sup>[2][XML link7]</sup> of 1998<sup>[3][XML link8]</sup> and several other related specifications<sup>[4][XML link9]</sup>—all of them free [open standards][XML link11]—define XML.<sup>[5][XML link10]</sup>
